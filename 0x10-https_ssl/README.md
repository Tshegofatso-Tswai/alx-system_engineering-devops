# 0x10-https_ssl

This directory contains information and scripts related to setting up and configuring HTTPS/SSL for web servers.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website you are connected to. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.

In this project, I explored the process of configuring and securing web servers using HTTPS/SSL.
